This file describes the scp architecture
Right now, it only includes microcode signals

MICROCODE SIGNALS
-----------------
Unless specified, all signals are active-high
FORMAT: [indexes]: SIGNAL_NAME - Description
-----------------
	-ALU_AND_GENERAL_REG_UNIT-	
0: A_BUS_WE - write value from AB_BUS_IN into A
1: A_ALU_WE - write alu result into A
2: B_BUS_WE - write value from AB_BUS_IN to B
3: B_A_WE - write value from A into B
[8:4]: ALU_OP - operation for alu to perform - see quartus/alu/alu.v for specific ops
	-BUS MUXES-
[10:9]: AB_BUS_IN_SEL - selects the value to be put on the AB_BUS_IN, 0=PC, 1=MDR(_OUT_BYTE_SHIFT_REG), 2=SP, 3=io_data_out
11: AB_BUS_OUT_SEL - selects which register the AB_BUS_OUT should be equal to, 0=A, 1=B
	-AB_BUS_OUT WE'S-
12: PC_BUS_WE - writes value from AB_BUS_OUT into PC
13: SP_BUS_WE - writes value from AB_BUS_OUT into SP
14: BP_BUS_WE - writes value from AB_BUS_OUT into BP
15: IO_DATA_BUS_WE - writes value from AB_BUS_OUT into io_data
16: IO_ADDR_BUS_WE - writes value from AB_BUS_OUT into io_addr
	-RAM_AND_MDR-
17: MDR_IN_BYTE_SEL - chooses which byte from AB_BUS_OUT goes into MDR, 0=low byte, 1=high byte
18: MDR_OUT_BYTE_LOW_WE - writes the value from MDR into MDR_OUT_BYTE_SHIFT_REG's low byte
19: MDR_OUT_BYTE_HIGH_WE - writes the value from MDR into MDR_OUT_BYTE_SHIFT_REGS's high byte
20: RAM_ADDR_WE - writes the value from the MMU into the RAM's MAR
21: RAM_DATA_WE - writes the MDR into memory
	-MAR_CTRL-
22: PC_INC - increment the PC
23: SP_INC - increment the SP
24: SP_DEC - deincrement the SP
[26:25]: MAR_MUX_SEL - selects which value from the MAR_MUX goes into the MMU's addrs_in, 0=A_REG, 1=PC, 2=SP, 3=0
	-DECODE-
27: IR_WE - writes value from MDR into IR
[29:28]: DECODE_MUX_SEL - selects the value to go into decode rom's addr, 0=MDR, 1=IR, 2=DECODE_NEXT, 3=0

	-SYS-
some num: PRIVILAGE_WE - set the privilage level
some num: PRIVILAGE_SET_LEVEL - level to set privilage to

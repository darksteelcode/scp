# Todo for OS
- [x] Basic FS (inodes, blocks, normal files, dirs, etc)
- [x] Device Files
    - [ ] Special device files (/dev/null, zero, random, etc)
- [ ] Pipes
    - [ ] Named Pipes (offsets have to be stored in inode - dev drivers need access to file_entry)
    - [ ] Device driver access to inodes members (needed for offsets)
- [ ] Environment Variables
    - [ ] exec e flag
    - [ ] exec p flag and PATH searching (c library, not kernel)
    - [ ] setenv, getenv, putenv, unsetenv, etc
- [ ] Errno Mechanism
    - [ ] all syscalls set errno on failure
- [x] Syscalls
    - [x] Check for already existing files (IMPORTANT) (NEED for mknod)
    - [x] Check for -1 file descriptors in syscalls dealing with them
    - [x] getpid, getppid
    - [x] open, creat, read, write, close
    - [x] lseek
    - [x] dup, dup2
    - [x] fork
    - [x] execv (will be execve)
        - [ ] argv passing
        - [ ] #! script handling
        - [ ] binary header handling - proper paging
    - [x] mkdir, rmdir
    - [x] opendir, readdir, closedir
    - [x] stat, fstat
    - [x] chmod, fstat
    - [x] chdir, chroot
    - [ ] pipe, mknod (dev + named pipe (just allow named pipe with mkfifo?)), mkfifo (needs named pipes)
    - [x] link, unlink
    - [x] ioctl
    - [x] exit
        - [x] zombie / orphan handling (don't make init do it)
        - [x] wait
    - [ ] brk, sbrk
- [x] Serial File Transfer Program
    - [ ] OS disk (with binaries) creation method
- [x] Init method (init process based on an initrc file)
